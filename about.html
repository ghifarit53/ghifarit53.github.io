	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
	Hello! My name is Ghifari. I love programming and creating small project.
	You can check them on my <a href="https://github.com/ghifarit53">github</a>.
	I have been interested in programming since I was really young. My first real programming
	language was Python, that was in junior highschool, and then I learnt Go in highschool
	to make the online school bell project which you can
	check on my <a href="https://github.com/ghifarit53">github</a> too.
	I'm also using Linux for almost three years. Actually it was because
	an accidental install that wiped all my Windows installation,
	but now I get really comfortable with Linux. You can read more about my setup <a href="/setup.html">here</a>.

	<h2>This website</h2>
	<p>I build this website with pure HTML and CSS because I want a super-lightweight site.
	Some of the CSS are borrowed from <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site</a>.
	This site's theme and some circles with their own colors you see
	at the very bottom of every page is a mirror of my
	current setup theme. They will get synced
	everytime I change my theme. I get this inspiration from
	<a href="https://notes.neeasade.net/">neeasade's blog</a>
	(you can read their article <a href="https://notes.neeasade.net/site-colors.html">here</a>)
