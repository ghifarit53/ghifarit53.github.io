	<h2>Setup</h2>
	<img src="/static/setup/screen.png" alt="screenshot">
	<p>
	Here you can find details of my current setup.
	<ul>
		<li>Laptop: IdeaPad 110 with 2GB of RAM.</li>
		<span>Enough to do some school task and small programming project. I don't do heavy gaming anyway.</span>

		<li>OS: GNU/Linux</li>
		<span>Specifically Ubuntu. I've been using Debian-based distro since
		my first journey on Linux. Actually my journey begin when I accidentally do a full-install of MX Linux,
		It was hard at first, everything was new for me. But I managed to completely migrate to Linux, and
		actually it was fun. I learnt more things about Linux and programming because of that accident. Then I switch to
		to Ubuntu for its PPAs. I actually want to try Arch-based distro (for its AUR), maybe sometime
		in the near future.</span>

		<li>WM: bspwm (<a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">repo</a>)</li>
		<span>Simple and lightweight tiling window manager. Can be easily scriptable with <code>bash</code> or <code>sh</code></span>

		<li>Browser: Google Chrome</li>
		<span>Feels faster and snappier and uses less RAM than Firefox.</span>

		<li>Editor: Vim</li>
		<img src="/static/setup/vim.png" alt="vim"><br>
		<span>Very lightweight and can be customized easily. With help of various plugins available
		on the internet, you can definitely make it works like an IDE. I'm just using a minimally configured Vim
		since I don't really do heavy coding.</span>

		<li>File Manager: <code>fff</code> (<a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff">repo</a>)</li>
		<img src="/static/setup/fff.png" alt="fff"><br>
		<span>TUI-based file manager, but I find myself more frequently use tools from <code>core-utils</code>
		like <code>cp</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>rm</code></span>

		<li>EPUB Reader: <code>epr</code> (<a href="https://github.com/wustho/epr">repo</a>)</li>
		<span>A minimal, TUI-based software to read epubs</span>
	</ul>
